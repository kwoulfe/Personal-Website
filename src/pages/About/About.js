          Full Stack Web Developer â€¢ Sacramento, California
          <br />
          <br />
          Currently working as a <i>Front End Web Production Specialist</i> for the California Chamber of Commerce.
          {/* About a year ago I decided to change careers from Bicycle Retail to
          Web Development. It's been one of the most rewarding decisions of my
          life. I once heard someone describe coding as "fireworks for your
          brain," and I couldn't agree more. I'm certainly not afraid of a
          challenge and for that reason alone, I know I'm in the right field. I
          love the problem solving and attention to detail that Web Development
          requires and take great joy in creating clean, workable sites with
          crisp and concise code. */}
          <br />
          <br />
          When I'm not coding, you'll find me riding my bike, hiking, camping,
          or building/fixing anything I can get my hands on.
          <br />

          My wife and I love to travel. All the lovely greenery photographed on
          this site is from a trip we recently took to Ireland. I can't wait to
          go back.
