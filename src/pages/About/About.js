        When I'm not coding, you'll find me riding my bike, hiking, camping, or
        building/fixing anything I can get my hands on. I also love baseball,
        watching movies, and eating good food.
        <br />
        My wife and I love to travel. All the lovely greenery photographed on
        this site is from a trip we recently took to Ireland. I can't wait to go
        back.
